Divide each cell in two rows and print pocket history in the lower row.

Pushed to `origin/gh-pages` and deployed.

- Edited App.jsx to split a cell to also display points in upper tr. JSX is more complicated than writing in HTML so let Gemini do that.

- Gemini had me check console output on Dev Tools on the browser and even set breakpoints. But point history was not displayed so rolled back the changes.

- Initialized the project using Vite and React, with the help from Gemini CLI.
- Updated `README.md` with project-specific details and removed the generic template content.
