# 5-9 Scorer Game Rules

## Definitions

*   **Points**: The base value gained by a player for pocketing a ball.
    *   5-ball: 1 point
    *   9-ball: 2 points
    *   These points are doubled if the ball is pocketed in a side pocket.
    *   These "points" are used for the "I/X" history display in the scoreboard.

*   **Score**: The numeric total of points accumulated by a player.
    *   This includes "points" gained from pocketing balls and "points" gained/lost from the "collect points" rule.
    *   **Collect Points Rule**: When a player pockets any ball, they gain "points" from each other player equal to the "points" value of the ball pocketed (doubled if pocketed in a side pocket). Each of the other players loses these "points".

## Default Settings

*   The game defaults to 3 players.
